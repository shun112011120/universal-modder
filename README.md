  <b>Skills, tools and a shared knowledge base that let any AI coding agent mod almost any PC game you own.</b><br>
  Works with Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot, OpenCode, or anything that reads <code>AGENTS.md</code>.<br>
  The agent finds the game, works out the engine and the route, reads the real code, builds the mod, makes art, 3D and sound
  with <a href="https://fal.ai">fal</a>, tests it in the running game, cuts the video, and writes down what it learned for the next agent.

## Install

Pick your agent. Each gets the same skills (Agent Skills format), the fal MCP server, and the `um` CLI.

| Agent | Install |
|---|---|
| **Claude Code** | `/plugin marketplace add rehan-remade/universal-modder`, then `/plugin install universal-modder@universal-modder` |
| **Codex** | `codex plugin marketplace add rehan-remade/universal-modder`, then `codex plugin add universal-modder@universal-modder` |
| **Gemini CLI** | `gemini extensions install https://github.com/rehan-remade/universal-modder` |
| **VS Code / Copilot** | Enable `chat.plugins.enabled`, run **Chat: Install Plugin From Source**, and enter this repo's URL |
| **Cursor** | Cursor Marketplace, or clone (Cursor reads `AGENTS.md` and `.cursor/mcp.json`) |
| **Skills only** (any agent) | `npx skills add https://github.com/rehan-remade/universal-modder` |
| **Anything else** | `git clone https://github.com/rehan-remade/universal-modder` and start your agent inside it |

Inside a clone, each agent finds the skills where it looks for them: `.agents/skills` (Codex and friends),
`.claude/skills`, `.gemini/skills` and `.github/skills` all link to `skills/`. Instructions are in
`AGENTS.md`, which `CLAUDE.md` and `GEMINI.md` point to. MCP config is in `.mcp.json`, `.codex/config.toml`,
`.cursor/mcp.json` and `.vscode/mcp.json`.

**The `um` CLI.** Plugin installs and clones put it on PATH. Anywhere else:
```bash
uv tool install git+https://github.com/rehan-remade/universal-modder     # or: pipx install git+...
```
**For assets,** get a [fal API key](https://fal.ai/dashboard/keys). It powers both the fal MCP server and
`um fal`:
```bash
export FAL_KEY=...
```
You also need Python 3.10+ and ffmpeg. `uv` is recommended. Blender is needed for 3D → sprite renders.
Windows games are driven natively or from WSL.

## The desktop app

Prefer clicking to typing? **Universal Modder** is a desktop app on top of the same toolkit:
- **Chat:** an AI on your own [Ollama](https://ollama.com) that mods games with the toolkit. It scans your
  games, reads the knowledge base and the engine playbooks, backs up saves, writes mod files into a workspace
  folder, and asks before it runs a command, restores a backup or writes anywhere else.
- **Games:** your Steam/Epic/Xbox games, each with its engine, anti-cheat, mod loaders, save folders and the
  best way to mod it.
- **Backups:** snapshot save folders, see what changed, restore.
- **Publish check:** the pre-release lint, with a clear verdict.

**Windows:** download **Universal Modder (Windows)** from the latest
[windows app](../../actions/workflows/windows-app.yml) run, unzip it (to your Desktop, say) and double-click
`UniversalModder.exe`. Or double-click `Universal Modder.cmd` in a clone; on first run it downloads uv and Python
into the folder. Both are portable: settings, backups, the app window's browser data and your mods (`My Mods`)
stay inside the folder, so moving or deleting the folder moves or removes everything. `um app` runs it on any OS.

For the chat, pull a model that supports tool calling (`ollama pull qwen3-coder` on a strong GPU, `qwen3:8b` on
smaller ones) and pick it in Settings. Everything stays on your PC: the window talks to a server on 127.0.0.1
with a per-launch token.

## Try it
> Mod Terraria: add a homing missile launcher and a tactical nuke that craters the world. Make the sprites with fal.

> Make a new civilization for Age of Empires II with a unique unit rendered from 3D.

> Put real Minecraft inside GTA V story mode. Minecraft's camera should follow GTA's, and its TNT should blow up GTA cars.

> What engine is `C:\Games\Foo`, and has anyone modded it before?

The agent starts with the **mod-any-game** skill and runs the same loop every time:
1. search the knowledge base;
2. recon, then pick a route;
3. set up a safe lab (saves backed up);
4. read the actual code;
5. build one working slice;
6. generate assets;
7. verify in the real game;
8. record;
9. package;
10. write a field note for the next agent.

## A knowledge base that AIs write for AIs
[`knowledge/`](knowledge/) holds **field notes**: how specific games were actually modded, decompiled and
reverse-engineered. Each note gives:
- the exact versions that worked;
- the route, and why;
- what the engine really does;
- how it was verified;
- the gotchas (symptom → cause → fix).

**Every agent that finishes a mod can open a pull request with its note**, so the next agent starts where it
left off instead of rediscovering the same traps.

```bash
um kb search "grand theft auto"                 # before you start: prior art (works outside the repo too)
um kb new --game "Hades II" --title "A new boon god" --from-scan hades --agent "Codex (gpt-6)"
um kb check knowledge/games/hades-ii/a-new-boon-god.md
um kb pr knowledge/games/hades-ii/a-new-boon-god.md --yes    # after your human says OK: branch, push, PR
```
Browse [`knowledge/INDEX.md`](knowledge/INDEX.md). Contribution rules, for humans and AIs, are in
[`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md): no game files, no decompiled dumps, nothing that helps cheat online,
and an honest status and verification.

## What's inside

**Skills** (`skills/`, Agent Skills format)

| Skill | What it does |
|---|---|
| `mod-any-game` | The whole loop, hard safety rules, and **12 engine playbooks**: Unity, Unreal, .NET/XNA (Terraria, Stardew, Celeste), Godot, Source 1/2, Bethesda, Minecraft, AoE2/Genie, RE Engine/FromSoft/GTA/Cyberpunk/BG3, native C++, indie engines (GameMaker, RPG Maker, Ren'Py, Paradox, Doom, HTML5, LÖVE, Java), retro decomps |
| `game-recon` | Prior field notes, engine and version, managed or native, anti-cheat, loaders, save folders, community route → `MODDING_PLAN.md` |
| `reverse-engineering` | ILSpy / Cpp2IL / Vineflower / Ghidra and IDA over MCP / Cheat Engine / Frida / RenderDoc; reverse-engineer a file format and prove it with a round trip |
| `fal-assets` | Sprites with real transparency, consistent variants, pixel art, seamless textures, PBR maps, image-to-3D, auto-rigging, SFX, music, voice, cutscene video |
| `asset-pipeline` | Art → engine-exact frames: cutout, nearest-neighbour fit, palettes, sheets, team-colour masks, 3D → 8/16-heading sprites |
| `game-automation` | Launch, screenshot (GPU-safe), click/type safely, windowed mode, crash-reporter cleanup, in-game agent bridges |
| `showcase-video` | Record the window with only the game's audio, pick moments, cut a styled video from an EDL |
| `mashup-mods` | Game inside a game: content ports, passthrough mods (worked example: Minecraft × GTA V), decomps as libraries, reimplementations |
| `publish-mod` | Lint, package per platform, credits, the post |
| `share-field-notes` | Search the knowledge base, write your own note, open the PR |

**The `um` CLI** (Python). Every command has `--help` with examples.

| | |
|---|---|
| `um scan` | Find Steam/Epic/Xbox installs; fingerprint engine and version, .NET vs native, anti-cheat, installed loaders, save folders, ranked routes |
| `um fal` | `sprite`, `image`, `edit`, `rmbg`, `pixelate`, `upscale`, `texture`, `pbr`, `model3d`, `rig`, `sfx`, `music`, `voice`, `video`, `run`, `search`, `schema`, `price`. Plain REST, with a manifest of every generation |
| `um sprite` | `cutout`, `fit`, `pixelate`, `palette`, `sheet`, `slice`, `frames`, `team-mask`, `seamless`, `preview` |
| `um render3d` | GLB → sprite frames from the game's camera (`aoe2`, `iso8`, `trueiso`, `topdown`, `side`, `turntable`) with Blender |
| `um win` | `shot`, `record` (gfxcapture + process-loopback audio), `drive` (input that only reaches the game), `ps`, `kill`, `launch`, `reg` |
| `um video` | `contact` sheets, `compile` (EDL → titled, beat-cut video with music), `mux`, `beats`, `first-frame` |
| `um backup` | Snapshot, diff and restore save folders |
| `um publish check` | Blocks shipping game files, decompiled code and leaked keys |
| `um kb` | The knowledge base: `search`, `show`, `new`, `check`, `index`, `sync`, `pr` |
| `um app` | The desktop app: AI chat on your own Ollama plus screens for games, backups and the publish check |

Two no-build Windows tools ship inside the package (`um/ps1/`): WinDrive input and ProcLoopback game-only
audio, both PowerShell with embedded C#.

## Built with it
- **[examples/terraria-tmodloader](examples/terraria-tmodloader)**: *Fal Arsenal* for tModLoader.
  - Weapons: a homing missile launcher, a tactical nuke (crater + mushroom cloud), a chain-lightning rifle, a
    black-hole gun and an orbital strike.
  - Three new enemies and a two-phase Drone Mothership boss.
  - Every sprite came from fal.
- **[examples/aoe2-de-civ](examples/aoe2-de-civ)**: *San Franciscans* for Age of Empires II DE.
  - A new civilization with a Robotaxi unique unit and Delivery Drones, rendered from fal image-to-3D models
    at AoE2's camera angle.
  - A Transamerica Pyramid wonder.
  - A reverse-engineered `.sld` sprite writer.
- **[examples/minecraft-gta5-passthrough](examples/minecraft-gta5-passthrough)**: real Minecraft inside
  GTA V story mode.
  - A Fabric mod and a ScriptHookV + ReShade add-on exchange camera, ground and events over a local
    WebSocket.
  - Minecraft's colour + depth are depth-composited into GTA's frame.
  - Minecraft TNT, arrows and fireworks become GTA explosions and bullets, and Minecraft mobs fight the
    police.

Each has a field note with every non-obvious lesson: [knowledge/INDEX.md](knowledge/INDEX.md).

## Rules it follows
- **Single-player and offline, on games you own.** It refuses to inject into online games with anti-cheat,
  write multiplayer cheats, or bypass anti-cheat, DRM or ownership checks.
- **It never ships game files or decompiled code.** Mods ship as code, your own assets, patches or
  converters.
- **It backs up before touching saves**, and kills processes by PID only.
- **It asks before** driving your mouse and keyboard, installing loaders into game folders, or publishing,
  PRs included.

## Credits
- Built from real agent sessions modding Terraria, Age of Empires II and GTA V × Minecraft.
- Assets: [fal](https://fal.ai) (GPT Image 2, Nano Banana 2, FLUX, Trellis 2, ElevenLabs...).
- Standing on the shoulders of tModLoader, genieutils-py, AoE2ScenarioParser, ScriptHookV, ReShade, Fabric,
  BepInEx, Harmony, UE4SS, REFramework, SKSE, ILSpy, Ghidra and every modding community that documented its
  game.
- The engine playbooks also draw on the September 2026 wave of AI-built mods, and on how their creators
  explained them in public.
